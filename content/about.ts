  intro: `I'm Ovie Okeh, a full-stack developer and product designer based in the Netherlands. I build software that solves real problems for real people.

I believe technology, when wielded with intention, is the most powerful tool for solving human challenges. This belief drives everything I create—from complex business applications to experimental side projects.`,
